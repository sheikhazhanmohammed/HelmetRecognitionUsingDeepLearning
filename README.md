# HelmetRecognitionUsingDeepLearning
The script uses Keras and Tensorflow to build an object recognition model.
To train the model just place the images in a folder named images where the photos of helmet goes in a subfolder named Helmet and photos which aren't of helmets go to a subfolder named NotHelmet.
